# Profile page project based on Angular, Pug, and Bootstrap

This project is for my personal profile page based on Angular, Pug and Bootstrap that I'm interested in. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.

## Angular loader for Pug
https://github.com/pugjs/pug

Angular framework doesn't support 'Pug' by default. But 'ng-cli-pug-loader' really helps to easily apply loader for interpreting .pug file so that clean and intuitive Pug formmated template can be used. 

## Styling with Bootstrap 4

This project uses Bootstrap 4 and the customized theme above.
